### Template A: Casual Parent Post

**Best for**: r/Parenting, r/homeschool

```
Title: Anyone else tired of math apps that just give the answer?

Been helping my 7th grader with algebra and tried a few apps. Most just
solve the problem FOR them, which defeats the purpose.

Found this app called StepWise that does something different - it gives
hints in layers. First it asks "what type of problem is this?" then
"what should we try first?" and only gives step-by-step if they're
really stuck.

They're in private beta right now and looking for US families to try it.
My kid actually had to think through a problem yesterday instead of
just copying an answer.

Link if anyone's interested: <APP_URL>
Code: <BETA_CODE>

Would love to hear what other parents are using for math help.
```

### Template B: Methodology-Focused Post

**Best for**: r/learnmath, r/education

```
Title: [Beta] Trying a Socratic approach to math tutoring (Grades 4-9)

We built StepWise because we noticed most math help apps have the same
problem: they solve FOR the student instead of guiding them to solve
it themselves.

Our approach uses layered hints:

**Layer 1 - Concept**: "What type of problem is this?"
**Layer 2 - Strategy**: "What's the first step to isolate x?"
**Layer 3 - Step-by-step**: Only if still stuck after trying

The idea is students build problem-solving skills, not just get homework done.

Currently in private beta for US families (grades 4-9). Looking for
honest feedback on:

- Does the hint progression make sense?
- Is the difficulty calibrated correctly?
- What's missing?

Try it: <APP_URL>
Beta code: <BETA_CODE>

Happy to answer questions about the approach.
```

### Template C: Parent Report Focus

**Best for**: Parents who want visibility

```
Title: Finally found a math app that tells me what my kid actually learned

Biggest frustration with homework help apps: I have no idea if my kid
is learning or just getting answers.

StepWise sends me a PDF report after each session showing:
- What problem they worked on
- Which hints they needed
- Where they got stuck
- What concepts to reinforce

It's like having a tutor who actually communicates with you.

Private beta for US families (grades 4-9):

Code: <BETA_CODE>

Anyone else wish more ed-tech had parent visibility?
